# M2-Embedded_Traffic-signal-system

       The  project  is  aimed  at  designing  a  density based dynamic traffic signal system 
        where the  timing of signal  will  change  automatically  on  sensing  the  traffic density  at
        any  junction.  Traffic  congestion  is  a  severe problem in most cities across the world and therefore
        it is time to shift more manual mode or fixed timer mode to an automated  system  with  decision  making 
        capabilities. Present  day traffic  signaling system  is fixed  time based which  may  render
        inefficient  if one  lane  is operational than the others. To optimize this problem we have made
        a framework  for  an  intelligent  traffic  control  system.
